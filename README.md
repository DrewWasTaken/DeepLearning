Deep Learning GAN Neural Network:

Images had to be split into seperate zip folders in order to upload, so order is a bit messy

Folders contain a LaTex report and project files containing the Raytracer

Project file contains a python script of the Neural Network and 2 folders each containing a dataset

Neural Network reads in dataset of thousands of images and outputs a series of fake images to 
best replicate the originals and trick the discriminator.
